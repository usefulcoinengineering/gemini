# script name: frontrunningtrailingstop.py
# script author: munair simpson
# script created: 20220816
# script purpose: buy the specified asset then sell it using a highest bid trailing stop-limit ask.


# Strategy Outline:
#  1. Buy BTC (by default) almost at the market price using the REST API (with a frontrunning USD bid).
#  2. Open a websocket connection and wait for confirmation that submitted bid order was filled.
#  3. Capture the price of the executed order and use it to calculate the last price that should trip the submission of a stop-limit order.
#  4. Monitor last price data until the transaction price exceeds the price target. 
#  5. Submit the initial stop limit order to sell BTC. If this order fills, exit. Otherwise, monitor prices for increases.
#  6. On the occasion that last price exceeds a new price target, cancel the old stop limit order and submit an updated stop-limit order to sell when the new price target is reached.
#  7. On the occasion that monitored ask prices indicate that the existing stop limit order should close, stop monitoring prices and exit.
#
# Execution:
#   - Use the wrapper BASH script in the "strategies" directory.
